summary: "We investigated the SD3's factor structure in three independent samples using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Machiavellianism and psychopathy items showed large general factor loadings while narcissism loaded more on a specific factor. A bifactor model fit best, and we recommend using the SD3 composite score rather than subscale scores."

##### Abstract

In the past decade, extensive interest has been directed toward the Dark Triad (i.e., Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy), popularly assessed by the Short Dark Triad (SD3). Nevertheless, relatively little research has been conducted on the SD3's factor structure. We investigated the psychometric properties in three studies with three independent samples, using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (N₁ = 1,487; N₂ = 17,740; N₃ = 496). In all three studies, Machiavellianism and psychopathy items displayed large general factor loadings, and narcissism larger specific factor loadings. In subsequent studies, two- and three-factor models fitted the data similarly, with the best fitting model being a bifactor model with items from Machiavellianism and psychopathy modelled as one specific factor, and narcissism as a second specific factor. On this basis, we suggest that the SD3 does not seem to capture the different mental processes theorized to underlie the similar behaviors generated by Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Additionally, we recommend the use of a single SD3 composite score, and not subscale scores, as subscales contain small amounts of reliable variance beyond the general factor.
